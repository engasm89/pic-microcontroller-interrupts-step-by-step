 * Course: Pic Microcontroller Interrupts Step By Step
 * Platform: Raspberry Pi
 * Author: Ashraf S A AlMadhoun
 * 
 * Description:
 * This code demonstrates the core concepts taught in the "Pic Microcontroller Interrupts Step By Step" course.
 * It provides a practical implementation that students can study, modify, and
 * use as a foundation for their own projects.
 * 
 * Learning Objectives:
 * - Understand the fundamental principles covered in this course
 * - Practice implementing the concepts with real code
 * - Build a working example that can be extended
 * 
 * Hardware Requirements:
 * - Development board (Raspberry Pi)
 * - Components as specified in CIRCUIT.md
 * - USB cable for programming
 * 
 * Pin Connections:
 * Refer to CIRCUIT.md for detailed wiring diagrams and pin assignments.
 * 
 * Usage:
 * 1. Review the code structure and comments
 * 2. Connect hardware according to CIRCUIT.md
 * 3. Upload code to your development board
 * 4. Monitor serial output for debugging
